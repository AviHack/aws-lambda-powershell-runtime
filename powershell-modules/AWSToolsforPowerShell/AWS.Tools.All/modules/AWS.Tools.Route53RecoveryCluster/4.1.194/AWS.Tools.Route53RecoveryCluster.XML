            List routing control names and Amazon Resource Names (ARNs), as well as the routing
            control state for each routing control, along with the control panel name and control
            panel ARN for the routing controls. If you specify a control panel ARN, this call
            lists the routing controls in the control panel. Otherwise, it lists all the routing
            controls in the cluster.

            A routing control is a simple on/off switch in Route 53 ARC that you can use to route
            traffic to cells. When a routing control state is On, traffic flows to a cell. When
            the state is Off, traffic does not flow.
            </para><para>
            Before you can create a routing control, you must first create a cluster, and then
            host the control in a control panel on the cluster. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/r53recovery/latest/dg/routing-control.create.html">

            With Route 53 ARC, you can add safety rules for routing controls, which are safeguards
            for routing control state updates that help prevent unexpected outcomes, like fail
            open traffic routing. However, there are scenarios when you might want to bypass the
            routing control safeguards that are enforced with safety rules that you've configured.
            For example, you might want to fail over quickly for disaster recovery, and one or
            more safety rules might be unexpectedly preventing you from updating a routing control
            state to reroute traffic. In a "break glass" scenario like this, you can override
            one or more safety rules to change a routing control state and fail over your application.

            The <code>SafetyRulesToOverride</code> property enables you override one or more safety
